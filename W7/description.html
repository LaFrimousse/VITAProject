    <h1>Project's Purposes</h1>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Show the performances of the new body posture recognization alogorithm of the  <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/"> VITA lab</a> of the EPFL by the following means:
      <ul>
        <li>Take pictures of the user, and display theses pictures with some points and lines added to the image so that the user can sees what the algorith does </li>
        <li>If possible (latence), try to perfom this on live (the user sees himself beeing filmed with the supperposition on the image of the points analysed by the server)</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li>Propose a WEB interface to the user that gives him the possibility of
      <ol>
        <li>making a training set for differents body postures by beeing recorded by the browser camera</li>
        <li>Run the K-NN algorithm on a new picture of himself (if possible, I will also try to do in on live) that will try to recognize to which body posture the new picture corresponds, based on the previously created training set</li>
        <li>Optional: gives to the user the possibility to tune the K-NN algorith using the web interface to sees the difference of the output of the alogrithm based on differents settings.</li>
      </ol></li>
